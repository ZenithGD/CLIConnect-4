# CLIConnect-4
A little CLI clone of the famous board game, Connect 4!

## Description

The game is in WIP, i'll be adding some features soon. It is a little project I use for practicing some coding skills and to introduce myself into the world of GitHub, as well as a way to start a simple project from beginning to end

This little console app simulates a Connect 4 game in the terminal (UNIX-only for now). The players can interact locally in the same computer, playing the game until one of them makes a 4 piece connection, or the board is complete.

The game works with a little turn system, where the player inputs the column where the new piece should be inserted. For now, the system is very basic, but i'm planning to add networking support and a little room system.

## Changes:

* Version 1.0:
  - Minimal working application, with a 2 player game simulation (the player number is hard-coded).
* Future version plans:
  - Timed turns 
  - Basic LAN game support (client-server architecture needed)
